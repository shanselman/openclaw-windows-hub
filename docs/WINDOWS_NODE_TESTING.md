# Windows Node Testing Guide

## Overview

The Windows Node feature allows the tray app to receive commands from the OpenClaw agent (canvas, screenshots, notifications). This is **experimental** and must be explicitly enabled in Settings.

## How to Enable

1. Open the tray app
2. Right-click → Settings
3. Scroll to "ADVANCED (EXPERIMENTAL)"
4. Toggle "Enable Node Mode" ON
5. Click Save

## What You Can Test Now

### 1. Settings Toggle
- Verify the toggle appears in Settings under "ADVANCED"
- Verify it saves and persists across app restarts

### 2. Node Connection
- Enable Node Mode and save
- Watch for "🔌 Node Mode Active" toast notification
- Check logs at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenClawTray\openclaw-tray.log` for:
  ```
  [INFO] Starting Windows Node connection to ws://...
  [INFO] Node connected, waiting for challenge...
  [INFO] Sent node registration with X capabilities, Y commands
  [INFO] Node registered successfully!
  [INFO] Node status: Connected
  ```

### 3. Screen Capture Notification
- When the agent captures your screen, you should see "📸 Screen Captured" toast
- This is throttled to max once per 10 seconds

## What Requires Gateway Support

These features need the gateway to send `node.invoke` commands:

| Command | Description | Expected Behavior |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| `canvas.present` | Show WebView2 window | Opens floating window with URL or HTML |
| `canvas.hide` | Hide canvas window | Closes the canvas window |
| `canvas.eval` | Execute JavaScript | Runs JS in canvas, returns result |
| `canvas.snapshot` | Capture canvas | Returns base64 PNG of canvas content |
| `screen.capture` | Take screenshot | Captures screen, shows notification, returns base64 |
| `screen.list` | List monitors | Returns array of monitor info |
| `system.notify` | Show notification | Displays toast notification |
| `camera.list` | Enumerate cameras | Returns device IDs and names |
| `camera.snap` | Capture photo | Returns base64 image (NV12 fallback) |

## Capabilities Advertised

When the node connects, it advertises these capabilities:
- `canvas` - WebView2-based canvas window
- `screen` - Screen capture via GDI
- `system` - Notifications
- `camera` - MediaCapture photo capture (frame reader fallback)

## Security Features

- **URL Validation**: Canvas blocks `file://`, `javascript:`, localhost, private IPs, IPv6 localhost
- **Screen Capture Notification**: User is notified when screen is captured
- **Node Mode Toggle**: Must be explicitly enabled by user
- **Command Validation**: Only alphanumeric commands with dots/hyphens allowed

## Troubleshooting

### Node doesn't connect
- Check that gateway URL and token are correct in Settings
- Check logs for connection errors
- Verify gateway is running and accessible

### No "Node Mode Active" notification
- Ensure Windows notifications are enabled for the app
- Check if notification settings in the app are enabled

### Canvas window doesn't appear
- Check logs for `canvas.present` command received
- Verify URL is not blocked by security validation

### Camera permission denied
- If you see "Camera access blocked", enable camera access for desktop apps in Windows Privacy settings
- Packaged MSIX builds will show the system consent prompt automatically

## Remaining Work (Roadmap)

1. **system.run + exec approvals**
   - Implement `system.run` with PowerShell/cmd support
   - Add `system.execApprovals` allowlist flow
2. **screen.record**
   - Graphics Capture video recording (MP4/base64)
3. **camera.clip**
   - Short webcam video capture (MediaCapture + encoding)
4. **A2UI end-to-end**
   - Resolve tool policy/allowlist and validate JSONL rendering
5. **Packaging & consent prompts**
   - MSIX packaging with camera/screen capabilities for system prompts
6. **Test matrix & polish**
   - Canvas/screen/camera regression tests
   - Handle timeouts/disconnects, reduce verbose logging
